# Upload artifacts to Maven Central

Developers expect to find artifacts in [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/). All artifacts
intended for public consumption
should be published in the [Maven Central repository maintained by Sonatype](https://search.maven.org). Even if a project is not built with Maven,
its artifacts can and should be published to Maven Central.

From here the artifacts are mirrored to many different local and public repositories. 

While Maven supports additional remote repositories,
this requires special configuration
in the pom.xml file. Tools other than Maven itself that 
use the repository system do not always read this information from the 
pom.xml files and often cannot load artifacts that are not available in Maven Central.

Developers who manually search for particular artifacts usually start at
Maven Central and sometimes don't look elsewhere.

Firewalls sometimes block access to third party repositories.
